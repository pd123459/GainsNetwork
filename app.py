        # Overview 
        
        This dashboard analyses the decentralized derivative trading platform Gains Network, the impact of its Arbitrum launch,
        and comparisons between Gains Network and its largest competitor GMX.  
        
        L2â€™s high speed and low gas provide an excellent venue for on-chain derivatives trading, and now L2 has become the main battlefield for trading derivatives.
        
        Key takeaways:
        
        1. Recent growth for the gains network is contributed by its deployment on Arbitrum on December 31, 2022. Since the launch, the trading activities on Gains Arbitrum soon outran its activities on Polygon, contributed by L2's high speed and low gas fees. 
        
        2. Traders on the Gains network tend to take positions with larger size and higher leverages on Arbitrum compared to Polygon. 
        
        3. Compared to its competitor GMX, Gains network remains a small derivative trading platform. However, the gap between trading volume is not as big as the gap between number of traders. With lower trading fees and more functionalities on Gains platform, it could potentially attract more institutional traders in the future.

    # Methodology 
    
    Data for the Gains network is identified using topics information in the arbitrum.core.fact_event_logs and polygon.core.fact_event_logs
    tables. Trade specific data is pulled from the data field and then converted from hex code to integers. These include trader address, 
    open price, current price, leverage, original position size, whether the trade is long or short, etc. The locations of these trade specific information
    in data differs for each code update, and are identified with different indexes in the underlying query. Profit and loss is then calculated
    for each closed trade. Below is a list of topics used:
    
    - Gains Polygon v5 (marketExecuted): 0xc74e5bdf3e3b91b5cda39fb8ee72fb93dbb735b9cbbaddc7eef34178ffbaf555
    - Gains Polygon v5 (limitExecuted): 0x15f192ad872076db7d7571711429e445b0eabf30dc598ab77f02cacf622eec83
    - Gains Polygon v6 (marketExecuted): 0x2343a1f0e076656e179f7fb23a0cb40efbb9cfaa668dd58344a840eb0306fec6
    - Gains Polygon v6 (limitExecuted): 0x9d894746ec0e0f1ac0599e4fdb9b9a250d21e0e23a6b9cf8c62bb8f5908bb40b
    - Gains Arbitrum & Polygon v6_1 & Polygon v6_2 (marketExecuted): 0x2739a12dffae5d66bd9e126a286078ed771840f2288f0afa5709ce38c3330997
    - Gains Arbitrum & Polygon v6_1 & Polygon v6_2 (limitExecuted): 0x165b0f8d6347f7ebe92729625b03ace41aeea8fd7ebf640f89f2593ab0db63d1
    
    Similar to data for the Gains Network, data for perpetual trading on GMX platform is identified using topics information 
    in arbitrum.core.fact_event_logs and avalanche.core.fact_event_logs tables:
    
    - GMX AVAX & Arbitrum Perpetual Trading: 0x2fe68525253654c21998f35787a8d0f361905ef647c854092430ab65f2f15022, 0x93d75d64d1f84fc6f430a64fc578bdd4c1e090e90ea2d51773e626d19de56d30
    - GMX AVAX & Arbitrum Swaps: 0xcd3829a3813dc3cdd188fd3d01dcf3268c16be2fdd2dd21d0665418816e46062
        
    Swap volume is then calculated using token price information from the ethereum.core.fact_hourly_token_prices table, 
    identified by contract address information in the event_inputs field. 
    
    The following data are then aggregated and used for analysis below: 
    
    - Daily Total Trading Volume: volume calculated uses post-leverage position size (leverage * positionsizeDai)
    - Daily Total Traders: the aggregated number of unique trader addresses on the platform
    - Daily Total Trading Fees: 0.1% per trade for GMX and 0.08% per trade for Gains network. This is not the gas fee paid for transfers. The fees for Gains network is simplified using fees charged for cryptocurrency trading as the most volume on gains network currently is from crypto trading. For the full Gains network fee schedule, see [Gains Fees and Spread](https://gains-network.gitbook.io/docs-home/gtrade-leveraged-trading/fees-and-spread).  
    - Average Position Size: the average post-leverage position size per trade
    - Leverage: aggregated leverage calculated using aggregated post-leverage volume divided by pre-leverage volume. This is only calculated for the Gains network.
    - Profitable Trader%: calculated using the total number of profitable closed trades divided by the total number of closed trades. This is only calculated for the Gains network.
        
    All of the data is drawn from [Flipside Crypto](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/),
